# K-means_from_scratch
Implementation of K-means algorithm for clustering tweets. 
Here, I implement the K-means clustering algorithm inorder to cluster tweets. This algorithm utilizes the Jaccard Distance metric.
The Jaccard distance formula is: Dist(A,B) = 1 - (|A âˆ© B|/|A U B|). Here is the reference for more details about Jaccard distance: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index 
The dataset used can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Health+News+in+Twitter.
Inorder to run, just execute the kmeans.py file.
